# Machine Learning courses with exercises
[`DL_note.pdf`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/DL_note.pdf) is the note I wrote in Prof. Ng's courses [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

The followings are notes and codes I took in the course [Machine Learning for Many Body Physics](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/video-library/collection/psi-2017/2018-machine-learning-many-body-physics-hayward-sierens) by Perimeter Institute.


In [MLPHY1 - Ising MC and NN.ipynb](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY1%20-%20Ising%20MC%20and%20NN.ipynb), MCMC sampling of Ising configurations is done and neural network from scratch is applied to classify the phases of Ising model.

Besides Ising model, lattice gauge theory is illustrated by Wegner model in [`MLPHY2 - Lattice Gauge.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY2%20-%20Lattice%20Gauge.ipynb). In this note, ground states of Wegner model are extracted and classified by Wilson line. Classifying the Wegner model's topological phases by CNN is done in [`MLPHY3 - CNN Lattice Gauge.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY3%20-%20CNN%20Lattice%20Gauge.ipynb)

Generative model is illustrated by Restricted Boltzmann Machine in the note [`RBM-notes.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/RBM-notes.ipynb) that I wrote in 10 to 12th lecture of [Machine Learning for Many Body Physics](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/videos/psi-2017/2018-machine-learning-many-body-physics-lecture-10). Its practice on Ising model is given in [`MLPHY5- RBM.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY5-%20RBM.ipynb).
