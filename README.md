# Machine Learning courses with exercises
[`DL_note.pdf`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/DL_note.pdf) is the note I wrote in Prof. Ng's courses [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

The followings are notes and codes I took in the course [Machine Learning for Many Body Physics](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/video-library/collection/psi-2017/2018-machine-learning-many-body-physics-hayward-sierens) by Perimeter Institute.


In [MLPHY1-Ising MC and NN.ipynb](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY1%20-%20Ising%20MC%20and%20NN.ipynb), I applied MCMC sampling to Ising configurations and neural network from scratch to classify the phases of Ising model.

Besides Ising model, lattice gauge theory is illustrated by Wegner model in [`MLPHY2-Lattice Gauge.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY2%20-%20Lattice%20Gauge.ipynb). In this note, ground states of Wegner model are extracted and classified by Wilson line. Classifying the Wegner model's topological phases by CNN is done in [`MLPHY3-CNN Lattice Gauge.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY3%20-%20CNN%20Lattice%20Gauge.ipynb)

Generative model is illustrated by Restricted Boltzmann Machine in the note [`RBM-notes.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/RBM-notes.ipynb) that I wrote in 10 to 12th lecture of [Machine Learning for Many Body Physics](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/videos/psi-2017/2018-machine-learning-many-body-physics-lecture-10). Its practice on Ising model is given by [`MLPHY5-RBM.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY5-%20RBM.ipynb).

Unsupervised learning of clustering Ising configuration is given by [`MLPHY6-tSNE.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY6%20-%20tSNE.ipynb)
