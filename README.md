# Machine Learning Phases of Matter and Generative Model
[`DL_note.pdf`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/DL_note.pdf) is the note I wrote in the deep learning courses [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

The followings are notes and codes for the Machine Learning for Many Body Physics taught course by Perimeter Institute.


In [MLPHY1-Ising MC and NN.ipynb](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY1%20-%20Ising%20MC%20and%20NN.ipynb), Markov chain Monte Carlo method is used to sample Ising configurations, and the from-scratch neural network is applied to recognize the phases of Ising model.

Lattice gauge theory is illustrated by Wegner model in [`MLPHY2-Lattice Gauge.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY2%20-%20Lattice%20Gauge.ipynb). In this note, ground states of Wegner model are extracted and classified by Wilson line. Classifying the Wegner model's topological phases by CNN is done in [`MLPHY3-CNN Lattice Gauge.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY3%20-%20CNN%20Lattice%20Gauge.ipynb)

Generative model is illustrated by Restricted Boltzmann Machine in the note [`RBM-notes.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/RBM-notes.ipynb). Its practice on Ising model is given by [`MLPHY5-RBM.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY5-%20RBM.ipynb).

Unsupervised learning of clustering Ising configuration is given by [`MLPHY6-tSNE.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY6%20-%20tSNE.ipynb)

A [`report`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/Report20191025.pdf) on summary of ML was given.

Searching for physics inspired generative model in [`Proposal A`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/QST-VB.pdf) and learning strong-interacting Hamiltonian in [`Proposal B`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/ProposalML.pdf) were in preparation.
