# Machine Learning Phases of Matter and Generative Model
[`DL_note.pdf`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/DL_note.pdf) is the note for deep learning basics.

Notes and codes for the Machine Learning for Many Body Physics.


In [MLPHY1-Ising MC and NN.ipynb](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY1%20-%20Ising%20MC%20and%20NN.ipynb), Neural network is established from scratch. Markov chain Monte Carlo method is used to sample Ising configurations, 

In [`MLPHY2-Lattice Gauge.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY2%20-%20Lattice%20Gauge.ipynb), simulate lattice gauge theory and extract ground states of Wegner model. Practice Wilson line for classification. Furthermore, classifying the Wegner model's topological phases by CNN is done in [`MLPHY3-CNN Lattice Gauge.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY3%20-%20CNN%20Lattice%20Gauge.ipynb)

In [`RBM-notes.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/RBM-notes.ipynb),generative model is illustrated by Restricted Boltzmann Machine. Its practice on Ising model is given by [`MLPHY5-RBM.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY5-%20RBM.ipynb).

In [`MLPHY6-tSNE.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/MLPHY6%20-%20tSNE.ipynb), practice unsupervised learning of clustering Ising configurations.

A [`report`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/Report20191025.pdf) on summary of ML was given.

In [`Proposal A`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/QST-VB.pdf) and [`Proposal B`](https://github.com/JSKao/ML_Phys/blob/master/ProposalML.pdf) are short proposals.
